The housing consists of three parts.  The "bottom" has four holes that are
deliberately slightly under-sized.  You can use either a 2.5 mm or #39
drill to enlarge the holes.  Then use an M3 x 0.5 tap to thread the holes.

The PCB is placed in the bottom housing, and then secured using "M-F"
stand-offs; i.e. stand-offs with one male end and one female end.  The top
cover will later be attached to the female end of the stand-offs.

The "front" is optional.  The idea is that we have cutouts for the various
jacks, but it would be very difficult to produce the thin sections needed with
a typical 3D printer.  Instead, we print a thin piece to go on the inside of
the box - the only purpose this serves is to make the package a bit neater.
It can easily be omitted.

The "top" can be printed in one color, or you can switch to a different
color after layer 4, to make the lettering stand out.
